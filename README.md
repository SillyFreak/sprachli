Fully & almost supported programs: [tests/programs/](tests/programs/)

Vague ideas for future features: [notes/](notes/)

## tasks

- complete set of operators and their precedence, [based on Rust's](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions.html#expression-precedence)
- structs
- `while`, possibly with an IR first
- typechecks & `match`
- `if let` and/or guard expressions
- pretty error messages
- bytecode verifier -> less internal errors during execution
